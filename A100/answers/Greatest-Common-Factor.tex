\section{Answers - Greatest Common Factor}
Pull out the greatest common factor from each expression. \\
\begin{enumerate}
%%%% 1  %%%%
\item $2x^{2} + 2x$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Firstly, we need to think about what, if anything, goes into each term. It is helpful to take care of the number first, and then the variables. In this case, it is obvious that they both share 2. Now looking at the variable, they all have some power of x, so the lowest power of x is going to be part of our GCF, in this case x.
  \item [] GCF=2x
  \item Now we need to divide each term by the GCF.
  \item [] {\Large $\frac{2x^{2}}{2x} + \frac{2x}{2x}$}
  \item [] $x+1$
  \item Now we need to put it all together for our answer, our GCF goes out front, and the remainder goes in parenthesis.
  \item $2x(x+1)$
  \end{itemize}
%%%% 2  %%%%
\item $7x^{3}y^{2} + 28x^{2}y^{2} - 21xy^{2}$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Firstly, we need to think about what, if anything, goes into each term. It is helpful to take care of the number first, and then the variables. In this case, they all share a factor of 7. Now looking at the variable, they all have some power of x, so the lowest power of x is going to be part of our GCF, in this case x. Now looking at the y, they all share some power of y, so the lowest power of y is going to be part of our GCF, in this case $y^{2}$.
  \item [] $GCF=7xy^{2}$
  \item Now we need to divide each term by the GCF.
  \item [] {\Large $\frac{7x^{3}y^{2}}{7xy^{2}} + \frac{28x^{2}y^{2}}{7xy^{2}} - \frac{21xy^{2}}{7xy^{2}}$}
  \item [] $x^{2}+4x-3$
  \item Now we need to put it all together for our answer, our GCF goes out front, and the remainder goes in parenthesis.
  \item $7xy^{2}(x^{2}+4x-3)$
  \end{itemize}
%%%% 3  %%%%
\item $30abx + 40ab$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Firstly, we need to think about what, if anything, goes into each term. It is helpful to take care of the number first, and then the variables. In this case, they all share a factor of 10. Now looking at the variable, they all have some power of a, so the lowest power of a is going to be part of our GCF, in this case a. Now looking at the b, they all share some power of b, so the lowest power of b is going to be part of our GCF, in this case b.
  \item [] GCF=10ab
  \item Now we need to divide each term by the GCF.
  \item [] {\Large $\frac{30abx}{10ab} + \frac{40ab}{10ab}$}
  \item [] $3x+4$
  \item Now we need to put it all together for our answer, our GCF goes out front, and the remainder goes in parenthesis.
  \item $10ab(3x+4)$ 
  \end{itemize}
%%%% 4  %%%%
\item $28a^{2}x^{2} - 48a^{2}x + 4a^{2}$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Firstly, we need to think about what, if anything, goes into each term. It is helpful to take care of the number first, and then the variables. In this case, they all share a factor of 4. Now looking at the variable, they all have some power of a, so the lowest power of a is going to be part of our GCF, in this case $a^{2}$.
  \item [] $GCF=4a^{2}$
  \item Now we need to divide each term by the GCF.
  \item [] {\Large $\frac{28a^{2}x^{2}}{4a^{2}} - \frac{48a^{2}x}{4a^{2}} + \frac{4a^{2}}{4a^{2}}$}
  \item [] $7x^{2}-12x+1$
  \item Now we need to put it all together for our answer, our GCF goes out front, and the remainder goes in parenthesis.
  \item [] $4a^{2}(7x^{2}-12x+1)$
  \end{itemize}
