\section{Sums and Differences of Cubes - Explanation}
This sheet is designed to teach the sum or difference of two perfect cubes methods. \\
\textbf{Formulas:} \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] $A^{3}+B^{3} = (A+B)(A^{2}-AB+B^{2})$
\item [] $A^{3}-B^{3} = (A-B)(A^{2}+AB+B^{2})$
\end{enumerate}
%%%% 1  %%%%
\textbf{Factor:} $x^{3} + 27$\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since the first step of all factoring is trying to pull out a GCF, I might be able to do that here. In this case I cannot.
\item Notice that this is two perfect cubes, as $x^{3}$ is the cube of x, and 27 is the cube of 3. $A^{3}=x^{3}, B^{3}=27, A=x, B=3$
\item Now we need to plug in to the formula.
\item [] $(A+B)(A^{2}-AB+B^{2})$
\item [] $(x+3)(x^{2}-3x+9)$
\item Done!
\end{enumerate}
%%%% 2  %%%%
\textbf{Factor:} $x^{3} - 125$\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since the first step of all factoring is trying to pull out a GCF, I might be able to do that here. In this case I cannot.
\item Notice that this is two perfect cubes, as $x^{3}$ is the cube of x, and 125 is the cube of 5. $A^{3}=x^{3}, B^{3}=125, A=x, B=5$
\item Now we need to plug in to the formula.
\item [] $(A-B)(A^{2}+AB+B^{2})$
\item [] $(x-5)(x^{2}+5x+25)$
\end{enumerate}
%%%% 3  %%%%
\textbf{Factor:} $x^{3} + 4096y^{3}$\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since the first step of all factoring is trying to pull out a GCF, I might be able to do that here. In this case I cannot.
\item Notice that this is two perfect cubes, as $x^{3}$ is the cube of x, and $4096y^{3}$ is the cube of 16y. $A^{3}=x^{3}, B^{3}=4096y^{3}, A=x, B=16y$
\item Now we need to plug in to the formula.
\item [] $(A+B)(A^{2}-AB+B^{2})$
\item [] $(x+16y)(x^{2}-16xy+256)$
\end{enumerate}
%%%% 4  %%%%
\textbf{Factor:} $x^{3} - 8$\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since the first step of all factoring is trying to pull out a GCF, I might be able to do that here. In this case I cannot.
\item Notice that this is two perfect cubes, as $x^{3}$ is the cube of x, and 8 is the cube of 2. $A^{3}=x^{3}, B^{3}=8, A=x, B=2$
\item Now we need to plug in to the formula.
\item [] $(A-B)(A^{2}+AB+B^{2})$
\item [] $(x-2)(x^{2}+2x+4)$
\end{enumerate}
%%%% 5  %%%%
\textbf{Factor:} $3x^{3} + 17496y^{3}$\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since the first step of all factoring is trying to pull out a GCF, I might be able to do that here. In this case they both have a 3 in common, so I can
\item [] $3(x^{3}+5832y^{3}$
\item Notice that this is two perfect cubes, as $x^{3}$ is the cube of x, and $5832y^{3}$ is the cube of 18y. $A^{3}=x^{3}, B^{3}=5832y^{3}, A=x, B=18y$
\item Now we need to plug in to the formula, remembering to bring down my GCF.
\item [] $(A+B)(A^{2}-AB+B^{2})$
\item [] $3(x+18y)(x^{2}-18xy+324)$
\end{enumerate}
