This is a project in LaTEX to provide resources for the mathematics courses I tutored most frequently. It is no longer in active development.

To compile the source to pdf on linux,
$ make

This project came from the need to make the Tutoring Center's resources permanent, as originally they were all loose-leaf paper in a filing cabinet. 
I then turned this in to a binder which attempted to be a complete guide for the course, and every math course the Center offered. 
After finding many errors, and no source files being present, this repository was created. 
It was mathematically verified by my direct supervisor, as well as judged on its readability/understandability.

Permission was granted to make my part of the contribution public by Dr. Ginny Heideman on 2016-01-12
